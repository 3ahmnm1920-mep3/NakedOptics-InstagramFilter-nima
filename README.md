## Idea

The main idea of this project is as already said to create an Instagram filter with the help of Spark AR - a software developed by facebook where you can program inteactive augmented reality experiences.
A 3D model made in Autodesk Maya of Naked Optics' ski glasses will be the base where we will create different effects with Spark AR.
