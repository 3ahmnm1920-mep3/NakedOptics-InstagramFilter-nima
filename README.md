# NakedOptics-InstagramFilter-nima

## Project Description

This project is all about the (ski) glasses from the company Naked Optics based in Salzburg.
The main goal is to create a filter based on their ski-glasses for the social media platform Instagram.
Everyone will build their own individual filter with different effects on the pre modelled glasses.

## Idea

The main idea of this project is as already said to create an Instagram filter with the help of Spark AR - a software developed by facebook where you can program interactive augmented reality experiences.
A 3D model made in Autodesk Maya of Naked Optics' ski glasses will be the base where we will create different effects with Spark AR.

## Concept



## Visuals

Some effect ideas:

* reflection of mountains 
* wind (sound)
* snow particles
* sun reflection/ lens flares
* stripes that move along the headband
* ski ramp background
* neon/ light effect on the edges of the glasses
* thermographic camera/ color effect?
* tap to change
